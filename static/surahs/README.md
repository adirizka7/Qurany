# Surahs
This folder is used by Qurany as a storage to access the murottal file. Currently only 1 Qari is supported because of the naming convention. In the future, Qurany aims to support more Qari. It's a work in progress. Cheers.

A glimpse of local folder, to show the format Qurany used to access the surahs file :
```
$ ls Qurany/static/surahs/
➜  surahs git:(master) ✗ ls
. . . . . 099.mp3  101.mp3  103.mp3  105.mp3  107.mp3  109.mp3  111.mp3  113.mp3
```
