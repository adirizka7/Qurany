# Surahs
This folder used by Qurany as a storage to access the murottal file. Currently only 1 Qari is supported that is Syaikh Mishary Rashid Alafasy. In the future, Qurany aims to support more Qari, but first we need to get the basic feature done first.

A glimpse of local folder, to show the format we used to access the surahs file :
```
$ ls Qurany/static/surahs/
➜  surahs git:(master) ✗ ls
. . . . . 099.mp3  101.mp3  103.mp3  105.mp3  107.mp3  109.mp3  111.mp3  113.mp3
```
