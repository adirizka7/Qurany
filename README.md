# Qurany
Qurany is a service that aims to help people memorize the holy Quran by rehearing the same verse over and over again. This service is not released yet cause I want to finish the core feature first

## Requirements
In the development process we currently use **Python 3.6.10**. The python library that we use in this directory can be found in requirements.txt. Make sure you have installed **pip**. We also highly recommend to use virtual env. In the future, maybe we'll add a Dockerfile as well to this repo.

## Quick Start
```
(venv) ➜  Qurany git:(master) ✗ pip --version
pip 20.0.2 from ~/Qurany/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip (python 3.6)
(venv) ➜  Qurany git:(master) ✗ pip install -r requirements.txt
.
.
.
(venv) ➜  Qurany git:(master) ✗ flask run
.
.
.
```
Now you're good to go. Just visit the Qurany site at **http://localhost:5000**
